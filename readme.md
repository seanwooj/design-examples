# Design Examples

A number of design patterns that may help and inspire you to build interesting pages yourself. Not tested in ie9 and below, because fuck that.

## Homepage
A basic example of a marketing homepage. This is useful for advertising your product. Pretty vanilla CSS and HTML, no bootstrap, so you actually can understand what's going on. I think this one is very useful.

## Content-Display
A basic example of a pinterest-like layout. This example uses jQuery and Masonry to organize all of the content. This one is pretty fun.

## Image Overlay
An example of overlaying a semi-transparent div over a black and white image for a cool effect.
